# EllisJared_SFG2

EDIT: I changed the name of the git repo from EllisJared_HW01 to EllisJared_SFG2 since I am going to continue to 
use this repo for the next project. I uploaded this readme before changing the name so the github link was incorrect.

This is the updated link:

Most difficult part was figuring out how to implement PowerUpBase and Invincibility Powerup.
Instructions on PowerUpBase Class didn't make enough sense to figure out entirely which then made
it hard to figure out next step on InvincibilityPowerup

Overall good assignment :)
